  <p>
    I'm Robin, a developer who has always loved working on the full web application stack. I have a passion for learning and for making things well. I also love the efficiencies and flexibility of working remotely, which I believe can be a great working model for technology companies.
  </p>

  <p>
    My enjoyment and passion for software development come from using creativity and attention to detail to make life easier for people, enabling them to do new things in a way that is intuitive and fun. I also love automating things in my own life: I am currently working on an iOS app to allow me to easily view variations of guitar chords. I strongly believe in the value of personal projects for learning new technologies and languages, and for trying out new ideas without risk.
  </p>

  <p>
    My natural curiosity and enjoyment of learning has led to me working with most of the popular frontend and backend web stack languages, and a variety of web frameworks. I am also experienced in database design, build automation and continuous integration. I am currently most interested in <strong>React</strong>, <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong> and <strong>Python</strong>-based backend frameworks like Flask. I recently started learning OCaml in order to experience working in a fully-functional programming language. I advocate things that improve code-quality, such as: code reviews, automated testing, linting.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I am a big people person, so I believe in a strong company culture. I have a proven track record of being easy to work with as a colleague. This also makes me a strong remote worker, as I am an empathetic and adept communicator. I love writing and sharing knowledge, and combine the two with a blog at: https://rsmith.io/blog. I would fit in well in a company with a culture that promotes learning, knowledge-sharing and a passion for seeking better ways of doing things.
