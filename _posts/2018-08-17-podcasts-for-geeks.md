Podcasts are an amazing invention - they allow you to keep your brain stimulated and learning whilst doing mundane, mindless or repetetive things, like cleaning, walking or driving. Or if your brain is a little more active than normal and craves constant stimulation, podcasts will be gold.

Developers as a whole often fall into the category of 'craves constant stimulation', and are possibly actively selected for as a measure of fitness in a constantly changing technological landscape.

Here are the podcasts I've stumbled across over the last few months and regularly listen to:

## Podcasts for geeks
### Being Freelance
Down-to-earth and entertaining weekly interviews with freelancers from all professions, sharing their freelancing tips.

### Syntax - Tasty Web Development Treats
Exactly as it says in the title - quick web development tips and fun chat.

### Faster than normal
If your brain runs a little faster than normal or even to the point of ADHD, this podcast will become your bible and I believe is useful for anybody serious about making the most out of their day!

### This Week In Science
This would have made my favorite podcast solely for its incredibly catchy and original intro, but the content is top-notch quality, humourous, consistent at once a week and generous with episodes at 1.5-2 hours in length!

### This Week In Startups
Twice-a-week podcast by Jason Calacanis covering tech news and topics and giving advice on all things angel investment and general business skills. Will be especially interesting if you have a bit of the entrepeneur in you.

### Ways To Change The World
Weekly podcast hosted by [Krishnan Guru-Murthy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krishnan_Guru-Murthy) from Channel 4 News. A little more general but will be interesting to the active and enquiring mind.

### StartUp Podcast
Interviews with entrepeneurs on running a successful startup.

### WSJ Tech News Briefing
Weekdaily. Really short, snappy 5-10 min episodes covering the main tech news for the day.

### Tech Stuff Daily
Weekdaily. 5-10 min episodes going into detail about a given tech news topic.

### Freelance Blend Podcast
Great tips and core listening material for freelancers!

### Killing It - Adventures In Start-ups and Mental Health
Very interesting title for a podcast - I'm unsure why these two topics should go together and also a little bit concerned! Can feel a little bit heavy at times so listen in moderation, but contains some very important stories from the world of start-ups with lessons that will be generally applicable.

### Planetary Radio: Space Exploration, Astronomy and Science
If you are interested in any of the above then you will love this podcast, which is also one of the most well-delivered podcasts I listen to.
