Podcasts are an amazing invention - they allow you to keep your brain stimulated and learning whilst doing mundane, mindless or repetetive things, like cleaning, walking or driving. Or if your brain is a little more active than normal and craves constant stimulation, podcasts will be gold. You'll even grow to hate doing those menial tasks less, safe in the knowledge that you are still actually doing something productive.

As a simple observation, developers as a whole often seem to fall into the category of 'craves constant stimulation', and are possibly actively selected for as a measure of fitness in a constantly changing technological landscape, blah blah ...

Below is a list of very educational and interesting podcasts that I've stumbled across over the last few months, which constitute an amazing resource for learning and development. I have briefly described each in my own words based upon hours of listening.

## Podcasts for geeks
### [Syntax - Tasty Web Development Treats](https://dev.to/syntax/)
Frequency: twice-weekly. Good chat, spliced with diverse and genuinely useful developer tips, from useful Javascript functions to editor plugins and life tips in general.

### [The Big Web Show](http://5by5.tv/bigwebshow)
Frequency: variable

### [Being Freelance](https://www.beingfreelance.com/)
Frequency: weekly. Down-to-earth, entertaining, humorous interviews with freelancers from all professions, sharing their freelancing tips. Perfect for freelancers or people thinking about freelancing.

### [Killing It - Adventures In Start-ups and Mental Health](https://open.spotify.com/show/449We08a4Ja7A4UuLkRRZD/)
Frequency: weekly. Slightly concerning title at first glance! Can be a bit heavy at times so listen in moderation, but contains some very important stories from the world of start-ups with lessons that will be relevant to most people in tech.

### [This Week In Startups](https://thisweekinstartups.com/)
Frequency: twice-weekly. Covers tech news and topics, whilst giving advice on business and investment. Especially interesting and informative are the live pitches which periodically happen on the show. Sometimes you just have to laugh at the audacity of the host Jason Calacanis and various Americanisms.

### [WSJ Tech News Briefing](https://www.wsj.com/podcasts/browse/wsj-tech-news-briefing)
Frequency: every weekday. Really short and snappy 5-10 min episodes covering the main tech news for the day.

### [Tech Stuff Daily](https://www.stuffmedia.com/techstuff-daily/)
Frequency: every weekday. 5-10 min episodes exploring a given tech news topic.

### [Faster Than Normal](https://www.fasterthannormal.com/)
Frequency: weekly. If your brain runs a little faster than normal or even to the point of ADHD, this podcast will become your bible and I believe is useful for anybody serious about making the most out of their day!

### [This Week In Science](https://www.twis.org/)
Frequency: weekly. This would have made my favorite podcast solely for its incredibly catchy and original intro, but the content is also top-quality, humourous, consistent at once a week and has long episodes (1.5-2 hours).

### [Planetary Radio: Space Exploration, Astronomy and Science](http://www.planetary.org/multimedia/planetary-radio/)
Frequency: weekly. If you are interested in any of the above then you will love this podcast, which is also one of the most well-delivered podcasts I listen to. At 823 episodes it's an inexhaustible resource. What a time we live in.

### [Ways To Change The World](https://www.channel4.com/news/ways-to-change-the-world-a-new-channel-4-news-podcast-tom-walker-aka-jonathan-pie)
Frequency: weekly. Hosted by [Krishnan Guru-Murthy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krishnan_Guru-Murthy) from Channel 4 News. A little more general but will be interesting to the active and enquiring mind.
