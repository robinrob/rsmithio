I've created a small tool named [Dicsaurus](https://github.com/robinrob/dicsaurus), out of a need to quickly look up
 words and synonyms for words, and out of a desire to make it as painless as possible.

Previously I was using the command-line `dict` tool in OS X, and for thesaurus just a ZSH function opening [thesaurus.com](http://www.thesaurus.com/)
 in a browser, with the search term encoded into a URL parameter.

Dicsaurus is a simple python script that makes HTTP callouts to [Oxford Dictionaries API](https://developer.oxforddictionaries.com/).
It currently works in two modes: dictionary and thesaurus. The [readme](https://github.com/robinrob/dicsaurus/blob/master/README.md)
explains how to set it up, including registering a developer account at [developer.oxforddictionaries.com](https://developer.oxforddictionaries.com).

## Example usage in dictionary mode
The word 'blue' turns out to be a good test word for both dictionary and thesaurus modes.

Command: `./dicsaurus.py -t blue`
