        <h3>Network Rail Business Information Tool</h3>
        <p>
          I spent two years helping to develop an internal business web application for Network Rail, built using AngularJS, Flask
          and MySQL.
          The application was for internal use to allow cost/benefit analysis, reporting and data management.
          I built a front-end report-building wizard combined with a server-side report generation engine capable of taking
          the user input and producing large PDF reports. The report generation engine was designed in a modular way to make adding
          new modules very easy. I also worked on financial algorithms and built numerous intuitive interfaces and wizards to
          allow manipulation of data by the user.
        </p>

      <li class='cf project-alumina'>
        <h3>Commercial Salesforce/Google synchronisation application</h3>
        <p>
          I was a core developer on a Force.com application to synchronise Email, Calendar and
          Contact information between Google Apps and Salesforce platforms. The application made use of
          techniques such as scheduled and batch Apex, triggers and web services.
          I architected and built a second stand-alone Force.com application acting as a licensing server, to perform product verification
          and registration, offering trial and paid functionality for the business' Force.com products.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li class='cf project-salesforce-s3'>
        <h3>Salesforce-AWS Email Backup and Archiving System</h3>
        <p>
          I designed and built an external email archiving and retrieval system for manaing Salesforce emails, using
          Python and running on Amazon EC2. Business-critical Salesforce data was stored and synced onto Amazon Web Services S3,
          reducing data storage costs.
          The system was successfully deployed for two separate customers. Automated testing helped ensure a high
          reliability of the system.
