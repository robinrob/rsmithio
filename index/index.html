          <p>
            I provide the following software development services:

              Front-end Web Development
            </h3>
            <p>
              I am experienced in both static website frameworks like Jekyll, and single-page application frameworks like AngularJS and React, as well as the essentials like HTML, CSS, SASS, Javascript, jQuery. I can build responsive
              pages that look great and work well on different screen sizes, across desktop and mobile. I can design sensible wizards and modals to take the user through complex data management workflows.
              I am experienced with automated front-end testing using Selenium, Karma and Protractor.

              Server-side development
            </h3>
            <p>
              I am experienced in server-side languages and technologies including: Python, Ruby, Flask, Django, Ruby on Rails.
              I can design and implement APIs and business logic to perform complex business functions such as data manipulation,
              financial computation and report generation.

              Database design
            </h3>
            <p>
              I can design database schemas to allow application logic to retrieve or modify the relevant data efficiently. I am experienced in MySQL and PostgreSQL.

              Test suites and Continuous Integration
            </h3>
            <p>
              I strongly believe in good automated testing to increase the reliabilty of code, especially where it is most complex or business-critical. I can implement automated front-end and back-end test suites
              and integrate these into a continuous integration workflow, using continuous integration tools such as Bamboo or CircleCI.

            <h3>
              Code Design
            </h3>
            <p>
              Code design is a crucial aspect of software development. In a previous project,
              I have designed a scalable server-side architecture which was taken up with enthusiasm by the rest of the team.
              Over time, it allowed the application to easily scale as the project grew.

            <h3>Network Rail Business Information Tool</h3>
            <p>
              I spent two years helping to develop an internal business web application for Network Rail, built using AngularJS, Flask
              and MySQL.
              The application was for internal use to allow cost/benefit analysis, reporting and data management.
              I built a front-end report-building wizard combined with a server-side report generation engine capable of taking
              the user input and producing large PDF reports. The report generation engine was designed in a modular way to make adding
              new modules very easy. I also worked on financial algorithms and built numerous intuitive interfaces and wizards to
              allow manipulation of data by the user.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li class='cf project-alumina'>
            <h3>Commercial Salesforce/Google synchronisation application</h3>
            <p>
              I was a core developer on a Force.com application to synchronise Email, Calendar and
              Contact information between Google Apps and Salesforce platforms. The application made use of
              techniques such as scheduled and batch Apex, triggers and web services.
              I architected and built a second stand-alone Force.com application acting as a licensing server, to perform product verification
              and registration, offering trial and paid functionality for the business' Force.com products.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li class='cf project-salesforce-s3'>
            <h3>Salesforce-AWS Email Backup and Archiving System</h3>
            <p>
              I designed and built an external email archiving and retrieval system for manaing Salesforce emails, using
              Python and running on Amazon EC2. Business-critical Salesforce data was stored and synced onto Amazon Web Services S3,
              reducing data storage costs.
              The system was successfully deployed for two separate customers. Automated testing helped ensure a high
              reliability of the system.
